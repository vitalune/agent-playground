This project proves a fundamental transformation in software engineering:

**Senior-level engineering skills** → **Agentic engineering skills**

Seven autonomous AI agents. One collaborative hub. Zero traditional coding constraints.

This isn't a portfolio of hand-coded projects—it's a **proof of concept** that orchestrated AI agents can build production-quality web experiences faster, more creatively, and with more polish than traditional development workflows.

Each mini-application was built by a different AI agent:
- **Cosmos** - Interactive space visualization
- **Synth** - Audio synthesis playground
- **Chronicle** - Dynamic timeline explorer
- **Pulse** - Real-time data visualization
- **Nexus** - Network graph interactions
- **Prism** - Gradient design studio
- **Echo** - Sound wave experiments

Each agent worked independently, yet they all share components and integrate seamlessly through a unified hub.

**The barrier to entry for building incredible software just collapsed.**

You don't need years of experience to orchestrate agents that can:
- Build complex interactive visualizations
- Implement sophisticated UI/UX patterns
- Create pixel-perfect, responsive designs
- Integrate multiple libraries and APIs seamlessly
- Collaborate through shared codebases

You need **vision, prompt engineering, and orchestration skills.**
